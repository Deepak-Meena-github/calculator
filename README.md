When a user clicks a button, the event listener triggers a function that performs the following actions:

Gets the text inside the button that was clicked and stores it in the variable "buttonText".
Checks if the button text is 'X' (representing multiplication). If it is, the code replaces it with the '*' character and concatenates it to the "screenValue" variable.
If the button text is 'C' (representing clear), the "screenValue" variable is reset to an empty string.
If the button text is '=' (representing the equals sign), the "screenValue" variable is evaluated using the built-in JavaScript "eval()" function, and the result is displayed on the calculator screen.
For all other button text, it is concatenated to the "screenValue" variable and displayed on the calculator screen.
In summary, this code enables the calculator application to take user input, perform basic arithmetic operations, and display the result on the screen.
